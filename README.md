# Wall-Street-Sentiments
We will be using the Reddit API from where we will analyze the sentiment on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit. For stock price information we are going to use the TDAmeritrade API. By combining insights from the data we extract, we want to predict the bullishness or bearishness of the NYSE(New York Stock Exchange) and of particular stocks on the exchange.
